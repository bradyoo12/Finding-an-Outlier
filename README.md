# Relevant tools, techniques and frameworks
- PyTorch
- Z-Score 
- Google colab

# What I learned
- How to calculate a z-score: z = (x - μ) / σ where μ is the average and σ is standard deviation
- Interquartile range above the 3rd quartile and below the 1st quartile
- How to identify an outlier: the upper boundary of Q3 + (1.5 * IQR) and the lower boundary of Q1 - (1.5 * IQR) where IQR is 3rd quartile - the 1st quartile
-
